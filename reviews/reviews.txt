Comments from the editor and reviewers (if any):

AEs: Please prepare a minor revision addressing the points raised by Reviewer 1.  Reviewer 2  also recommended to accept with minor revisions, with no specific changes requested.  We ask that you submit your revised paper within four weeks. 


Reviewer #1: This paper presents a brute-force search method on feature selection for face recognition. The authors test the method on LFW and reach a competitive result. The authors also test the on synthetic faces to verify the robustness of the proposed method. Some detail comments are as following:

1. Although the method is probably inspired from biological facts, the proposed method still cannot correspond to V1-V3. I suggest to change the title and some claims on V1-V3 in the paper.

2. As the brute-force search need a lot of computational cost, I suggest the authors to add some parts to emphasize the computation detail.

3. Fig. 4(c) could be a table but not figure.
